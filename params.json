{"name":"ethereum.builders","tagline":"ideate. iterate. co-create. ","body":"Welcome home, ethereum builder!\r\n=====\r\nThis is a community for like-minded individuals, passionate about ethereum and the possibilities it opens. This is a community for people like you, that like to create and experiment. You are welcome to experiment here, so throw your craziest of ideas on the boards and in the chatrooms. Have fun!\r\n\r\n### Hacking GitHub :)\r\n\r\nGitHub is great. It make things easier for everyone and speeds up the growth of projects thanks to its collaboration features. \r\n\r\nThe following serves as a proposed collaboration system for this community, in the lack of something else as of now. In this guide it will be assumed that you already are setup with a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet make sure to get one at ______. \r\n\r\n#### Step one. Supercharge GitHub workflows.\r\n\r\nTransform your usual GitHub account into a powerful project management tool in just two steps:\r\n\r\n**1.** Go to https://www.zenhub.io/ or directly install the Chrome extension from [the webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd)\r\n\r\n**2.** Connect your GitHub account with Zenhub. \r\n* You can check if everything went okay by checking [your Github application settings](https://github.com/settings/applications). You should see ZenHub as one of the authorized applications.\r\n\r\nPlease read these two articles if you want to understand more about how ZenHub works:\r\n* [Getting started with ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/getting-started-with-zenhub/)\r\n* [Supercharge GitHub Workflows](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/supercharge-github-workflows-introducing-zenhub-part-i/)\r\n\r\n*Please note that you __need__ to install the zenhub extension in order to view and use GitHub as described in this guide. \r\n\r\nIf ZenHub has been correctly installed, then a new tab called **\"board(s)\"** should appear on your GitHub repo pages. The **board(s)** are populated by the issues created, each new issue becoming a card on the new ZenHub board tab. The _B_ key serves as a keyboard shortcut to display the boards in repos, while _F_ is used for quick repo switching. \r\n\r\nThis is how a populated board should look like:\r\n\r\n![Boards on GitHub via ZenHub](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c653bdc5842cf262547739eeca8d620fe49754e1/68747470733a2f2f7777772e7a656e6875622e696f2f626c6f672f636f6e74656e742f696d616765732f323031342f4f63742f4f7267616e697a65642d426f6172642e6a7067)\r\n\r\n### Step two. Supercharge GitHub interactivity.\r\n\r\nIn order to coordinate well besides GitHub we also use an application called Gitter. Very straightforward setup process, incredibly well suited app for distributed communities and projects like this one. With this tool you're able to transform your favorite repos into your favorite chatrooms ^_^\r\n\r\nGet started by signing up for the free account and allow it the access it needs in order to function properly. For those of you that don't like the permissions requested please read this:\r\n\r\n* [Why do you ask for write access to my profile?](https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200178961-Why-do-you-ask-for-write-access-to-my-profile-)\r\n* [You want write access on my private repos? Are you insane?](https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200178971-You-want-write-access-on-my-private-repos-Are-you-insane-)\r\n\r\nTime for step three!\r\n\r\n#### Step three.
