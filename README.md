### Hacking GitHub :)

GitHub is great. It make things easier for everyone and speeds up the growth of projects thanks to its collaboration features. 

The following serves as a proposed collaboration system for this community, in the lack of something else as of now. In this guide it will be assumed that you already are setup with a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet make sure to get one at ______. 

#### Step one. Supercharge GitHub workflows.

Transform your usual GitHub account into a powerful project management tool in just two steps:

**1.** Go to https://www.zenhub.io/ or directly install the Chrome extension from [the webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd)

**2.** Connect your GitHub account with Zenhub. 
* You can check if everything went okay by checking [your Github application settings](https://github.com/settings/applications). You should see ZenHub as one of the authorized applications.

Please read these two articles if you want to understand more about how ZenHub works:
* [Getting started with ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/getting-started-with-zenhub/)
* [Supercharge GitHub Workflows](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/supercharge-github-workflows-introducing-zenhub-part-i/)

*Please note that you __need__ to install the zenhub extension in order to view and use GitHub as described in this guide. 

If ZenHub has been correctly installed, then a new tab called **"board(s)"** should appear on your GitHub repo pages. The **board(s)** are populated by the issues created, each new issue becoming a card on the new ZenHub board tab. The _B_ key serves as a keyboard shortcut to display the boards in repos, while _F_ is used for quick repo switching. 

This is how a populated board should look like:

### Step two. Supercharge GitHub interactivity.

In order to coordinate well besides GitHub we also use an application called Gitter. Very straightforward setup process, incredibly well suited app for distributed communities and projects like this one. With this tool you're able to transform your favorite repos into your favorite chatrooms ^_^

Get started by signing up for the free account and allow it the access it needs in order to function properly. For those of you that don't like the permissions requested please read this:

* [Why do you ask for write access to my profile?](https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200178961-Why-do-you-ask-for-write-access-to-my-profile-)
* [You want write access on my private repos? Are you insane?](https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200178971-You-want-write-access-on-my-private-repos-Are-you-insane-)

Time for step three!

#### Step three. Join the fun :)

#### Megacombo!!!! Tokenize GitHub comments.

A token of appreciation goes a long way! Mention the lucky @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send.

Here's how to get you started:

**1.** Connect your GitHub account with [Changetip](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/github)

* You can check if everything went okay by checking [your Github application settings](https://github.com/settings/applications). You should see ChangeTip as one of the authorized applications.

**2.** Reward programmers for their effort by simply mentioning their @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send. For example "@changetip send 0.01 BTC to @username".
